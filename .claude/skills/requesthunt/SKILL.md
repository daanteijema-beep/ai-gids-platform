# RequestHunt Skill

Generate user demand research reports by collecting and analyzing real user feedback from Reddit, X (Twitter), and GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Install the CLI and authenticate:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://requesthunt.com/cli | sh
requesthunt auth login
```

The CLI displays a verification code and opens `https://requesthunt.com/device` — the human must enter the code to approve. Verify with:
```bash
requesthunt config show
```
Expected output contains: `resolved_api_key:` with a masked key value (not `null`).

For headless/CI environments, use a manual API key instead:
```bash
requesthunt config set-key rh_live_your_key
```

Get your key from: https://requesthunt.com/dashboard

## Output Modes

Default output is TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) — structured and token-efficient.
Use `--json` for raw JSON or `--human` for table/key-value display.

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Define Scope

Before collecting data, clarify with the user:
1. **Research Goal**: What domain/area to investigate? (e.g., AI coding assistants, project management tools)
2. **Specific Products**: Any products/competitors to focus on? (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
3. **Platform Preference**: Which platforms to prioritize? (reddit, x, github)
4. **Time Range**: How recent should the feedback be?
5. **Report Purpose**: Product planning / competitive analysis / market research?

### Step 2: Collect Data

```bash
# 1. Trigger realtime scrape for the topic
requesthunt scrape start "ai-coding-assistant" --platforms reddit,x,github --depth 2

# 2. Search with expansion for more data
requesthunt search "code completion" --expand --limit 50

# 3. List requests filtered by topic
requesthunt list --topic "ai-tools" --limit 100
```

### Step 3: Generate Report

Analyze collected data and generate a structured Markdown report:

```markdown
# [Topic] User Demand Research Report

## Overview
- Scope: ...
- Data Sources: Reddit (X), X (Y), GitHub (Z)
- Time Range: ...

## Key Findings

### 1. Top Feature Requests
| Rank | Request | Sources | Representative Quote |
|------|---------|---------|---------------------|

### 2. Pain Points Analysis
- **Pain Point A**: ...

### 3. Competitive Comparison (if specified)
| Feature | Product A | Product B | User Expectations |

### 4. Opportunities
- ...

## Commands

### Search
```bash
requesthunt search "authentication" --limit 20
requesthunt search "oauth" --expand                          # With realtime expansion
requesthunt search "API rate limit" --expand --platforms reddit,x
```

### List
```bash
requesthunt list --limit 20                                  # Recent requests
requesthunt list --topic "ai-tools" --limit 10               # By topic
requesthunt list --platforms reddit,github                    # By platform
requesthunt list --category "Developer Tools"                # By category
requesthunt list --sort top --limit 20                       # Top voted
```

### Scrape
```bash
requesthunt scrape start "developer-tools" --depth 1         # Default: all platforms
requesthunt scrape start "ai-assistant" --platforms reddit,x,github --depth 2
requesthunt scrape status "job_123"                          # Check job status
```

### Reference
```bash
requesthunt topics                                           # List all topics by category
requesthunt usage                                            # View account stats
requesthunt config show                                      # Check auth status
```
